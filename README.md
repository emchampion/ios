Folder for ios practice applications using xcode and swift


<b>BasicInteraction Practice</b>
This simple application is practicing linking buttons from the story board to the viewController. I implemented ways for the keybaord to be removed so it would no longer take up viewing space.

<b>InterfaceExample</b>
This app is simply for practicing constraits for the square view container used. This application will be removed from GitHub at a later date

<b>Date Picker</b>
Fun little app designed to let the user pick a date and it will notify what day of the week that will be. I was practicing a more complex interaction with picker.

<b>Data Picker</b>
Using the data picker wheel I was practicing delegation.
